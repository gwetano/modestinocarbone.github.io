# Modestino Carbone's Personal Page

Welcome to my [personal website](https://modestinocarbone.github.io/), a space dedicated to my web projects, digital experiments, and useful tools I create and share freely.

## 🔍 Purpose of the Site

This site serves as a showcase for my web-based experiments and utilities, with a strong focus on simplicity, accessibility, and mobile-friendly design. The layout is clean and responsive, designed to work well on all screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Featured Tool: PDF to Text Converter

One of the main tools featured here is the [PDF to Text Converter](https://modestinocarbone.github.io/pdf_to_text.html).  
It allows you to extract text content from PDF files and view it in a mobile-optimized format that’s much easier to read on phones and tablets.

## 📁 Site Structure

- `index.html`: The main page with an overview and links to my projects
- `pdf_to_text.html`: The tool for converting PDFs to readable text
- Additional assets: CSS, JavaScript, and other static resources
